# The Goals of the Random Message Generator Project:

1. -[ ] First is to build a random message generator
2. -[ ] Use version control to manage the project
3. -[ ] Use the command line
4. -[ ] Develop Locally in my own computer.

## Planning the Project itself.

I can add whatever what I want.
How will my program work...

### Random Message
A sentence is composed of 2 parts, a subject and a predicate
inside of the predicate we have the object of the sentence.
So we can divide a sentence in 3 parts, subject, verb, object.

I want really just random messages, it will not have an specific topic
It will follow the standard english sentence formation. Meaning subject, verb, object
The subject will be things, verb will be a verb, object will be another object.

I could use three arrays one for subject, one for verbs, one for predicates. 
The Random Message Generator will follow the convention of You should: " verb a/with object/animal"
